detect colors using python opencv


# Project Name: Color Detection in Images

# Project's Brief Details:  

This is a color detection Python project, the aim is to build an application through which you can automatically 
get the name of the color by clicking on them in the picture. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its 
values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.
